   About Hiveminder Cloud Tasks

  About

   Written by [1]Paul Miller.

   This app is pretty much just a caching GUI for the
   [2]http://hiveminder.com/ website. They encourage building applications
   like this by offering a very nice self-discovering [3]ReSTful API.

   Bugs and feature requests can be reported via [4]HMCT-feeedback — this is
   a spam filtered email address that simply feeds my hiveminder task queue.

   You may also report bugs and request features by using the github issue
   tracker:

   [5]http://github.com/jettero/hmct/issues

   The entire source for this app can be found on github:

   Some unreleased, release candidate and historical builds can be found on
   the gh-pages:

   Hiveminder Cloud Tasks Help

  Account Required

   You will need a Hiveminder account in order to use this app. If you do not
   have one, click here to get one:

   [1]http://hiveminder.com/splash/signup/.

   You won't regret signing up. Hiveminder is probably the coolest way to
   track your tasks yet invented. You can interact with your tasks via email,
   IM, the command line, and IMAP. Basically whatever seems handy at the
   time.

  Hiveminder Help

   For assistance with Hiveminder terms and features, please browse their
   help pages on the web:

   [2]http://hiveminder.com/help

  Other Help

   My hope is that the interface is intuitive enough that, once users are
   already acclimatized to Hiveminder, most things are obvious enough to not
   require a help document at all. This obviously isn't very realistic, but
   that is the goal. For additional help, just [3]shoot me an email.

  Bugs

   You will undoubtedly find bugs in this application. You will also find
   that certain things are missing. Please do not report these things to the
   Hiveminder staff unless you're quite certain they are Hiveminder bugs and
   not actually a problem with this application.

   Bugs and feature requests can be reported via [4]HMCT-feeedback — this is
   a spam filtered email address that simply feeds my hiveminder task queue.

   You may also report bugs and request features by using the github issue
   tracker: [5]http://github.com/jettero/hmct/issues

   If you have some other question or concern (and don't wish to open a
   support ticket about it); just [6]shoot me an email instead.
