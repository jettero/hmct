  About

   Written by [1]Paul Miller.

   This is version 0.5.0 of HMCT.

   The 0.5.0 release (code name TXNQ) is a milestone release. It is intended
   to be a view-only client.

   This app is pretty much just a caching GUI for the
   [2]http;//hiveminder.com/ website. They encourage building applications
   like this by offering a very nice self-discovering [3]ReSTful API.

   Bugs and problems should be reported in the Github issue tracking system:
   [4]http://github.com/jettero/hmct/issues

   The entire source for this app can be found there as well:

   probably the coolest way to track your tasks yet invented. You can
   interact with your tasks via email, IM, the command line, and IMAP.

  Hiveminder Help

   For assistance with Hiveminder terms and features, please browse their
   help pages on the web:

  Other Help

   My hope is that the interface is intuitive enough that, once users are
   already acclimatized to Hiveminder, most things are obvious enough to not
   require a help document at all. This obviously isn't very realistic, but
   that is the goal. For additional help, just [3]shoot me an email.

  Bugs

   You will undoubtedly find bugs in this application. You will also find
   that certain things are missing. Please do not report these things to the
   Hiveminder staff unless you're quite certain they are Hiveminder bugs and
   not actually a problem with this application.

   Bugs and feature requests for this application should be reported via the
   github issue tracker only.

   If you are unable or unwilling to operate the github issue tracker, if you
   have a question regarding your issue (e.g. whether it is an issue at all),
   or if you just have some other concern; just [5]shoot me an email instead.
