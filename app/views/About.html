        <h3>About</h3>
        <p> Written by <a href="http://jettero.github.com/">Paul Miller</a>.</p>

        <p> This is version 0.5.0 of HMCT.</p>

        <p> <em>The 0.5.0 release (code name TXNQ) is a milestone release.  It is intended to be a <strong>view-only</strong>
            client.</em> </p>

        <p> This app is pretty much just a caching GUI for the
            <a href="http://hiveminder.com/">http;//hiveminder.com/</a>
            website.  They encourage building applications like this by
            offering a very nice self-discovering <a href="http://hiveminder.com/help/reference/API.html">ReSTful API</a>.
        </p>

        <p> Bugs and problems should be reported in the Github issue tracking system:
