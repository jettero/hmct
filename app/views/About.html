        </p>

        <p> This app is pretty much just a caching GUI for the
            <a href="http://hiveminder.com/">http://hiveminder.com/</a>
            website.  They encourage building applications like this by
            offering a very nice self-discovering <a href="http://hiveminder.com/help/reference/API.html">ReSTful API</a>.
        </p>

        <p> Bugs and feature requests can be reported via
            <a href="mailto:HMCT-feedback@voltar.org">HMCT-feeedback</a> —
            this is a spam filtered email address that simply feeds my
            hiveminder task queue.
