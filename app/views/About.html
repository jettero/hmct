        <h3>About</h3>
        <p> Written by <a href="http://jettero.github.com/">Paul Miller</a>.</p>

        <p> This app is pretty much just a caching GUI for the
            <a href="http://hiveminder.com/">http;//hiveminder.com/</a>
            website.  They encourage building applications like this by
            offering a very nice self-discovering <a href="http://hiveminder.com/help/reference/API.html">ReSTful API</a>.
        </p>

        <p> Bugs and feature requests should be reported via
