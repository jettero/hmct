        <h3>Account Required</h3>

        <p> You will need a Hiveminder account in order to use this app.
            If you do not have one, click here to get one: </p>

            <div class="url">
                <a href="http://hiveminder.com/splash/signup/">http://hiveminder.com/splash/signup/</a>.
            </div>

        <p> You won't regret signing up.  Hiveminder is probably the
            coolest way to track your tasks yet invented.  You can interact
            with your tasks via email, IM, the command line, and IMAP.
            Basically whatever seems handy at the time.  </p>

        <h3> Hiveminder Help </h3>
        <p> For assistance with Hiveminder terms and features, please
            browse their help pages on the web: </p>

            <div class="url">

            </div>

        <h3> Other Help </h3>
        <p> My hope is that the interface is intuitive enough that, once
            users are already acclimatized to Hiveminder, most things are
            obvious enough to not require a help document at all.  This
            obviously isn't very realistic, but that is the goal.  For
            additional help, just <a href="mailto:jettero@gmail.com">shoot me an email</a>.
            </p>

        <h3> Bugs </h3>
        <p> You will undoubtedly find bugs in this application.  You will
            also find that certain things are missing. Please do not report
            these things to the Hiveminder staff unless you're quite
            certain they are Hiveminder bugs and not actually a problem
            with this application. <p>

        <p> Bugs and feature requests should be reported via
            <a href="mailto:HMCT-feedback@voltar.org">HMCT-feeedback</a> â€”
            this is a spam filtered email address that simply feeds my
            hiveminder task queue.
        
        <p> If you have some other question or concern (and don't wish to
            open a support ticket about it); just <a
            href="mailto:jettero@gmail.com">shoot me an email</a> instead.
