        <h3>View Only</h3>

        <p> This release is <em>view only</em>.  There is no interface or
            creating, removing, completing or editing tasks. </p>

        <h3>Account Required</h3>

        <p> You will need a Hiveminder account in order to use this app.
            If you do not have one, click here to get one: </p>

            <div class="url">
                <a href="http://hiveminder.com/splash/signup/">http://hiveminder.com/splash/signup/</a>.
            </div>

        <p> You won't regret signing up.  Hiveminder is probably the
            coolest way to track your tasks yet invented. You won't regret
            signing up.  Hiveminder is probably the coolest way to track
            your tasks yet invented.  You can interact with your tasks via
            email, IM, the command line, and IMAP.  Basically whatever
            seems handy.  </p>

        <h3> Hiveminder Help </h3>
        <p> For assistance with Hiveminder terms and features, please
            browse their help pages on the web: </p>

            </div>

        <h3> Other Help </h3>
        <p> My hope is that the interface is intuitive enough that, once
            users are already acclimatized to Hiveminder, most things are
            obvious enough to not require a help document at all.  This
            obviously isn't very realistic, but that is the goal.  For
            additional help, just <a href="mailto:jettero@gmail.com">shoot me an email</a>.
            </p>

        <h3> Bugs </h3>
        <p> You will undoubtedly find bugs in this application.  You will
            also find that certain things are missing. Please do not report
            these things to the Hiveminder staff unless you're quite
            certain they are Hiveminder bugs and not actually a problem
            with this application. <p>
        
        <p> Bugs and feature requests for this application should be
            reported via the github issue tracker only. </p>

        <p> If you are unable or unwilling to operate the github issue
            tracker, if you have a question regarding your issue (e.g.
            whether it is an issue at all), or if you just have some other
            concern; just <a href="mailto:jettero@gmail.com">shoot me an email</a>
